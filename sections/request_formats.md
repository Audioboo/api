# How API Requests / Responses should be formatted

# API Call Format #

## Request URLs ##
Being a REST-style API, all calls are made to paths based on the resource you're accessing. For more specifics on individual resources, see the [API Reference](https://github.com/audioboom/api/blob/master/sections/reference_index.md).

For example, if you're trying to access a list of clips a user is following, you'll make HTTP `GET` request to:

`https://api.audioboom.com/users/12/audio_clips/followed`

where 12 is the id of the user you're interested in.

If you were trying to upload a clip to the linked user, you'd make a HTTP `POST` to:
`https://api.audioboom.com/account/audio_clips`

## Standard Parameters ##
You should always include a `version` parameter in your Accept header, to maintain compatibility when we update the API.  The current public version is `1`.  For example, `Accept: application/json; version=1`.

## Request Parameter Encoding ##
Parameters required by the API call can be submitted in one of a few ways:

  * [Query String Parameters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
  * Parameter data in HTML request body ([W3C Spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1)):
  * URL-encoded field data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
  * multipart/form-data (multipart/form-data)

 _NOTE:_ multipart/form-data _must_ be used when posting large fields, such as an uploaded audio-file.

## Response Encoding ##
JSON is used as the default response type, other formats have been deprecated.

###Examples:
`curl https://api.audioboom.com/audio_clips`

```json
{
	"timestamp":1255083877,
	"version":200,
	"body":{
		"audio_clips":[
		{
            "id": 12345, 
            "title": "New Romney Beach", 
            "duration": 136.2, 
            "location": {
                "accuracy": 70.0, 
                "description": "Ashford, Kent, United Kingdom", 
                "latitude": 51.1245, 
                "longitude": 0.869696
            }, 
            "tags": [
                {
                    "display_tag": "beach", 
                    "normalised_tag": "beach", 
                    "url": "http://audioboom.com/tag/beach"
                }, {
                    "display_tag": "summer", 
                    "normalised_tag": "summer", 
                    "url": "http://audioboom.com/tag/summer"
                }
            ], 
            "recorded_at": "2009-04-29T16:28:14Z", 
            "uploaded_at": "2009-04-29T20:22:29Z", 
            "urls": {
                "detail": "http://audioboom.com/boos/12345-new-romney-beach", 
                "high_mp3": "http://audioboom.com/boos/12345-new-romney-beach.mp3", 
                "image": "http://audioboom.com/files/images/0004/4474/clipAttachment.jpg"
            }
			...
```

_NOTE:_ If you use JSON-P, you also need to supply a `callback` parameter which is used as the wrapper function when the data is returned.

## Response Envelope ##
When data is returned in the format you have requested, the root object is always a hash that acts as a response envelope allowing out-of-band data to be passed back to the application. As it currently stands, the server only returns an api-version key and the servers integer timestamp.

Any response data relating to the request made will _always_ be returned in the `body` element of this hash.

## Response Status Codes ##
The response status code will follow [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).  All successful requests will return a 2xx HTTP status code, i.e. 200 for a normal request, 201 for a request in which an entity is created (such as an Audio Clip).

For failed requests, the server will typically return a suitable status value. If there is an internal server failure, for example, you will receive a 500 status code which should be presented to the user as a transient failure that should resolve itself at some point.

API failures caused by errors in the request will have two HTTP headers added to the serverâ€™s response,  `X-Audioboo-Error_code` and `X-Audioboo-Error_description`. The failure in this case is due to a failure between the client and the server, such as invalid signature or disabled service or source keys on the server.

A special case to this is the Audioboo error code 800, which indicates that the API version attached to the request sent is out of date and not supported by the server. In this case, it would be a wise idea to display the description sent by the server directly to the user as this will probably contain instructions on updating the client. No further attempts should be made to communicate with the server as they will result in the same response.
